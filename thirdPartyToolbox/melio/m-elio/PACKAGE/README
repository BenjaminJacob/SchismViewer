This is a m-elio package (matlab elio)
It works with output of ELCIRC and SELFE models (Data Format 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0)
It also includes an interpolation (in xy) and visualization (in xy).
For more details see EXAMPLE_*.m files

Limitations: functions: *_computeZlevels.m and ob_ini_staFromPars.m work most of the time. 
- *_computeZlevels.m will give different results than SELFE at dry nodes
- ob_ini_staFromPars.m uses matlab triangulation tools. Hence, can give different results than ELCIRC for quadrangular elements, and on the non-convex parts of the grid boundary.
